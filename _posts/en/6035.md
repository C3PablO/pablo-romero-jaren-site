After 60 years of learning and 35 years of teaching, Maria Jose retired, and her family wanted to celebrate her retirement and birthday party with an illustration that depicted her career as a talented preschool teacher and educator. The illustration was used for digital invitations, wine bottle labels, and was also framed as a present for her.
