# Electrolux's SHAPE Design System.

At Electrolux, within the SHAPE design system team, my role as a UX engineer has been a journey of continuous learning and contribution across various aspects of design and technology. SHAPE, an ambitious project distributed throughout the digital organization at Electrolux, spans three different platforms: web, mobile, and appliances. My involvement in SHAPE has allowed me to engage in numerous activities, offering me a unique opportunity to learn from different touchpoints within the organization.

During my time working with SHAPE, I have contributed to the following activities:

## UI Design

I've been instrumental in creating design libraries and assets, focusing on the visual aspects, interaction and  documentation. My efforts have been particularly concentrated on reducing complexity and working closely with developers to ensure the best alignment possible between the components in Figma and the components in code.

With focus on native mobile, I've also taken a special interest in creating themes for various brands and modes, ensuring that our design system can adapt to different brand identities while maintaining accessible and consistent experiences. Organizing design resources, and aligning with users of the design system thuough sync sessions and workshops have been crucial in ensuring adoption.

## Design engineering

As a Design Technologist, I've laid the groundwork for automating and optimizing our design processes. This has involved creating the necessary infrastructure and pipelines, utilizing scripts, and developing Figma plugins to streamline workflows. My leadership in the design tokens community has been vital in standardizing design elements and ensuring consistency across our platforms. [Token Studio](https://tokens.studio/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) have been vital tools working with design tokens.

Solving technical issues that arise between designers and developers has been another critical aspect of my role. By facilitating communication and understanding between these two groups, I've helped to smooth out the integration of design and development. Additionally, I've worked on translating different brand visual identities into aligned color palettes, ensuring that our design system can accommodate diverse brand aesthetics while maintaining a unified look and feel.

## Visual Design

In my capacity as a Visual Designer, I've been responsible for creating the visual brand of the design system itself. This has involved applying our design principles and aesthetic to the documentation site, presentations, and communications, making the design system recognizable and accessible within the organization.

## Web Development

Developing the design system portal has been a significant part of my responsibilities. Using the [Supernova](https://www.supernova.io/) platform, I've built a central hub for the design system that is not only informative but also automatically updated through various automations. This portal has become a key resource for contributors from different design fields within the organization.

## Other Activities

Beyond my primary roles, I've engaged in additional activities that enrich my professional experience and contribute to the broader community. I've served as a mentor in the [STEM:FEM](https://www.electroluxgroup.com/en/electrolux-group-launches-stemfem-and-donates-100-mentorship-hours-to-stem-students-35035/) mentorship program, offering guidance and support to students in the STEM field. Participating in UX design and research, sketching sessions, and roundtable discussions have also been integral to my development and contribution to the field of design.
