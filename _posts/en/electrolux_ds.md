# SHAPE

SHAPE is Electrolux groupâ€™s design system for cohesive and efficient design and development.

<br/>

## My role
The project spans three different platforms: web, mobile, and appliances and my involvement in SHAPE has allowed me to engage in numerous activities, offering me a unique opportunity to contribute and learn across various aspects of design and engineering.
<br/>
My efforts have been particularly concentrated on: 

- Creating high quality UI components and design assets.
- Reducing complexity and streamlining design processes both for the design system and its audience.
- Providing documentation for different aspects of the system.
- Working closely with designers and developers to ensure the best alignment possible between graphics and code. 
- Providing an optimal and accessible experience for the end user.

<br/>

## UI Design & Development

As a UI designer with a focus on native mobile platforms, I specialise in crafting delightful and accessible user interfaces tailored to iOS and Android. My work involves designing UI components and developing cohesive brand themes and visual modes allowing for flexibility and expression.
<br/>
 I've also contributed to build the foundations of the design system as setting up the infrastructure and definition of **design tokens** with [Token Studio](https://tokens.studio/), [Figma Variables](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/14506821864087-Overview-of-variables-collections-and-modes) and [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) being the core tools.
<br/>
Additionally, I believe coding is a vital part of the UI design process, enabling a deeper understanding of how design decisions translate into real user experiences. Knowing the end technology helps me design more effectively, anticipating constraints and opportunities early on. I enjoy contributing with my coding skills to the development of UI components for native mobile using SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose to both experiment and build production-ready interfaces.

## Design operations

Streamlining design processes is key for reducing cost enabling space for creativity and allowing people to do the work they enjoy the most. In order to help in this area I've contributed with scripts, Figma plugins and GitHub actions removing manual processes and repetitive tasks from people's work.

## Visual Design

To convince others of something, high-quality communication is key. I've utilized my graphic design skills to create the brand identity of the design system itself, from the logo and the aesthetics of the documentation site to presentation slides and merch, making the design system recognizable and its communication consistent throughout different touchpoints.

## Web Development

Developing the design system portal has been a significant part of my responsibilities. Using the [Supernova](https://www.supernova.io/) platform the team have created a central hub for the design system. The portal is connected to different sources of data that keeps the documentation updated through automations abd contributors from different parts of the organization.

## Other Activities
Beyond my primary role, I've engaged in additional activities that enrich my professional experience and contribute to the broader community.

### 2025 - Accessibility
I've engaged into activities regarding accessibility as attending meet-up sessions outside the organization, learning to use assistive technology and to design and develop for a broader audience making desing more inclusive.

### 2024 - Motion design
I joined the animation workgroup to investigate, explore and define an animation system for the user interfaces in the Electrolux group.

### 2023 - Mentoring
I served as a mentor in the [STEM:FEM](https://www.electroluxgroup.com/en/electrolux-group-launches-stemfem-and-donates-100-mentorship-hours-to-stem-students-35035/) mentorship program, offering guidance and support to students in the STEM field. Participating in UX design and research, sketching sessions, and roundtable discussions have also been integral to my development and contribution to the field of design.
