It looks like someone has lost a sock. Perhaps the octopus under the bed took it? or maybe the ghost in the library has seen it? Regardless where it is, finding this sock is going to be an adventure.

Follow the wonderful story of four charismatic creatures looking for a missing sock and explore the joy of searching and finding even though the things one finds are not always the ones expected.

To create this story I was inspired by my daughter Violeta who loves taking off her socks at any time since she was a baby and like the one in the book her socks end up in all sort of unexpected places. Violeta has a very creative mind and if she doesn't know where the socks are she tell us ingenious stories when we ask.
