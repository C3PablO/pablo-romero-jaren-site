# ¿Dónde Está Mi Calcetín?

It looks like someone has lost a sock. Perhaps the octopus under the bed took it? Or maybe the ghost in the library has seen it? Regardless of where it is, finding this sock is going to be an adventure.


Join the wonderful story of four charismatic creatures on their search for a missing sock, and discover the joy of searching and finding, even when the things found are not always the ones expected.

## The story behind

I was inspired to create this story by my daughter Violeta, who loves taking off her socks since she was a baby. Like the character in the book, her socks end up in unexpected places. Violeta has a very creative mind, and when we ask her where her socks are, she comes up with ingenious stories.
