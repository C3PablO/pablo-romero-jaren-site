# Transforming doodles into art
Here is my final project for an illustration course that I took from one of my favorite Swedish artists, Mattias Adolfsson. The course guides you through his creative process and teaches you how to create beautiful illustrations simply by appreciating the small things in life and using your imagination.

# 6035

After 60 years of learning and 35 years of teaching, Maria Jose retired, and her family wanted to celebrate her retirement and birthday party with an illustration that depicted her career as a talented preschool teacher and educator. The illustration was used for digital invitations, wine bottle labels, and was also framed as a present for her.
