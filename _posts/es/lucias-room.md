Awaiting Lucia's arrival, I've painted a mural reflecting our unique global family, blending the different cultures we belong to. A celestial tapestry features northern and southern constellations and a diverse animal kingdom - our heritage embodied. This mural isn't just art, but a promise of unity and love across borders. To Lucia, may your life mirror this vibrant diversity.
