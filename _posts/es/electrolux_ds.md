I've been brewing something special at Electrolux as a Senior Designer in Design Systems. Unfortunately, they don’t like us to share the work we do at the Design Studio but imagine creating a world of components in Figma that speak a universal design language across diverse platforms. That's my everyday magic.

I've been able to integrate strategies from software development into our design practices, fostering a marriage of tech and artistry. It’s been a journey of automation, component crafting, and curating design tokens that help streamline our processes while preserving the aesthetic charm.

The Design System Documentation site? Yes, that’s been my canvas too! Curating and refining content, also providing the system with its own brand image reflection of the group design philosophy.
