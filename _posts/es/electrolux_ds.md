# SHAPE

SHAPE is a design system for cohesive and efficient design experience and development serving the digital organization at Electrolux.

<br/>

## My role
The project spans three different platforms: web, mobile, and appliances and my involvement in SHAPE has allowed me to engage in numerous activities, offering me a unique opportunity to contribute and learn across various aspects of design and technology.

My efforts have been particularly concentrated on: 
<br/>
- Providing high quality assets and reducing complexity for the audience of the system
- Working closely with developers to ensure the best alignment possible between design and code. 
- Enabling adoption of the system though good communication and workshops.
- Provide an optimal experience for the end user.

## UI Design

With mostly focus on native mobile I've been instrumental in creating design libraries and assets, focusing on the visual aspects, interaction and documentation of UI components. Always with an eye on accessibility I've also taken a special interest in creating themes for various brands and modes, ensuring that our design system can adapt to different brand identities while maintaining accessible and consistent experiences.

## Design engineering

As a Design Technologist, I've laid the groundwork for automating and optimizing our design processes. This has involved creating the necessary infrastructure and pipelines, utilizing scripts, and developing Figma plugins to streamline workflows. My leadership in the **design tokens** community has been vital in standardizing design elements and ensuring consistency across our platforms. [Token Studio](https://tokens.studio/), [Figma Variables](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/14506821864087-Overview-of-variables-collections-and-modes) and [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) have been vital tools working with design tokens.

As a UI designer is crucial for me to understand as much as possible the technology stack I design for. I'm never afraid of learning a new programming language and jump into code. With my coding skills I've not only solved desing problems but also facilitated workshops and conversations to help easing technical issues with different profiles of people involved.

## Visual Design

To convince others of something, high-quality communication is key. I've utilized my visual design skills to create the brand identity for the design system itself, from the logo and the aesthetics of the documentation site to presentation slides, making the design system recognizable and its communication consistent throughout the organization.

## Web Development

Developing the design system portal has been a significant part of my responsibilities. Using the [Supernova](https://www.supernova.io/) platform the team have created a central hub for the design system. The portal is connected to different sources of data that keeps the documentation updated through automations abd contributors from different parts of the organization.

## Other Activities

### 2024
I joined the animation workgroup to investigate and define how to systematize and organize animation in our user interfaces.

### 2023
Beyond my primary roles, I've engaged in additional activities that enrich my professional experience and contribute to the broader community. I've served as a mentor in the [STEM:FEM](https://www.electroluxgroup.com/en/electrolux-group-launches-stemfem-and-donates-100-mentorship-hours-to-stem-students-35035/) mentorship program, offering guidance and support to students in the STEM field. Participating in UX design and research, sketching sessions, and roundtable discussions have also been integral to my development and contribution to the field of design.
