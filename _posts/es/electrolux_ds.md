# SHAPE

SHAPE is Electrolux group’s design system for cohesive and efficient design and development.

<br/>

## My role
The project spans three different platforms: web, mobile, and appliances and my involvement in SHAPE has allowed me to engage in numerous activities, offering me a unique opportunity to contribute and learn across various aspects of design and engineering.
<br/>
My efforts have been particularly concentrated on: 

- Designing and developing high quality UI components and design assets.
- Automating, streamlining, and reducing complexity in processes.
- Providing design system documentation and training.
- Building bridges between design and engineering. 
- Ensuring a rich and accessible experience for the end user.

## UI Design & Development

For creating great user interfaces, a solid foundation is essential. At SHAPE, I’ve been deeply involved in shaping the design system pillars as design tokens, scalable color palettes, and documentation.
<br/>
Beyond these foundations, I focus on designing and developing delightful, accessible user interfaces tailored for native mobile applications.
<br/>
Alongside interaction and visual aspects, a key part of my role is ensuring alignment between design and code, so components behave and feel the same across both worlds. To bridge the gap between design intent and implementation, I leverage tools such as Figma Code Connect, enabling product developers and AI tools to access the right context for building consistent, user-centred experiences.

## Design operations

Streamlining design processes is key for reducing cost enabling space for creativity and allowing people to do the work they enjoy the most. In order to help in this area I've contributed with scripts, Figma plugins and GitHub actions removing manual processes and repetitive tasks from people's work.

## Visual Design

To convince others of something, high-quality communication is key. I've utilized my graphic design skills to create the brand identity of the design system itself, from the logo and the aesthetics of the documentation site to presentation slides and merch, making the design system recognizable and its communication consistent throughout different touchpoints.

## Web Development

Developing the design system portal has been a significant part of my responsibilities. Using the [Supernova](https://www.supernova.io/) platform the team have created a central hub for the design system. The portal is connected to different sources of data that keeps the documentation updated through automations abd contributors from different parts of the organization.

## Other Activities
Beyond my primary role, I've engaged in additional activities that enrich my professional experience and contribute to the broader community.

### 2025 - Accessibility
I've engaged into activities regarding accessibility as attending meet-up sessions outside the organization, learning to use assistive technology and to design and develop for a broader audience making desing more inclusive.

### 2024 - Motion design
I joined the animation workgroup to investigate, explore and define an animation system for the user interfaces in the Electrolux group.

### 2023 - Mentoring
I served as a mentor in the [STEM:FEM](https://www.electroluxgroup.com/en/electrolux-group-launches-stemfem-and-donates-100-mentorship-hours-to-stem-students-35035/) mentorship program, offering guidance and support to students in the STEM field. Participating in UX design and research, sketching sessions, and roundtable discussions have also been integral to my development and contribution to the field of design.
