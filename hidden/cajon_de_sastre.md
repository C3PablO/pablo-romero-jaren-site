# Cajón de Sastre
In Spanish, "Cajón de sastre" is an expression used to refer to a collection of various and disorganized things. In this case, a collection of unrelated cretive projects.

Art and illustration have always been close to my heart, embodying both a passion and a personal journey of continuous discovery and expression. My fascination with drawing transcends the boundaries between the traditional and the digital, allowing me to explore the vast landscapes of creativity through different mediums.
No matter how busy life gets, I always find time to doodle something. 



## Transforming Doodles Into Art
Here is my final project for an illustration course that I took from one of my favorite Swedish artists, Mattias Adolfsson. The course guides you through his creative process and teaches you how to create beautiful illustrations simply by appreciating the small things in life and using your imagination.

## 6035

After 60 years of learning and 35 years of teaching, Maria Jose retired, and her family wanted to celebrate her retirement and birthday party with an illustration that depicted her career as a talented preschool teacher and educator. The illustration was used for digital invitations, wine bottle labels, and was also framed as a present for her.

## Kame Grill

 I was thrilled to blend the worlds of culinary artistry and anime passion in a commission for a friend who not only masters the kitchen as a chef but also harbors a deep affection for the iconic universe of Dragon Ball. This artwork represents a unique fusion, where the fiery zeal of cooking meets the explosive energy of Dragon Ball's battles. By integrating elements of both realms, I aimed to capture the essence of my friend's dual passions, crafting a visual narrative that resonates with the intensity of a chef's flame and the dynamic power of a Super Saiyan.

  ## Random characters
I love how Procreate makes the creative process so portable, allowing me to spend time here and there creating small characters.
