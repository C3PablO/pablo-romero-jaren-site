Often I find myself taking screenshots or pictures of things to extract color palettes. Yeah, I don't know if that's normal but I enjoy it. I spend lots of time playing with color, shape, composition and trying to make sense of it. When I'm not doing that I enjoy climbing, running or playing Legos with Bea and Violeta. I don't have a cat.",
  "page.index.text.contact": "Btw, I'm based in Stockholm. It is a nice place if you like nature, cycling and you are ok with cold rainy weather and long months of darkness. If you want to meet in person ping me for a coffee. I don't know what else to say so: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua and have a happy life.",
