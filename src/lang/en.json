  "page.index.text.whoami": "My name is Pablo and I'm a UI Designer and Graphic Artist who's super passionate about what I do. Sometimes I catch myself taking screenshots or pictures of things just to get the color palettes. It might sound weird, but I really enjoy it. I spend tons of time messing around with colors, shapes, and composition, trying to make sense of it all. When I'm not doing that, I love to go rock climbing, running, or play Legos with Bea and Violeta.",
  "page.index.text.contact": "Right now, I'm working on Design Systems for Electrolux, and I'm based in Stockholm. It's a pretty cool city if you're into nature, cycling, and don't mind the cold, rainy weather and long months of darkness. If you're ever around and want to catch up over coffee, just give me a shout!",
